# ☀️ SolarSmart.ai - Intelligent Solar Monitoring & Forecasting

An award-winning platform that combines custom IoT hardware with an AI-powered application to make solar energy intelligent, efficient, and reliable.

**SolarSmart.ai** is an end-to-end solution for solar performance management. Our proprietary "Live Digital Twin" IoT device captures critical performance metrics in real-time, streaming them to our cloud-native dashboard. This platform provides users with live monitoring, predictive energy forecasts, and a powerful "what-if" simulator to model and optimize system changes.

## 🏆 Award-Winning Innovation

Our vision and technology were recognized at the prestigious **Shell Changemakers** event in Bangalore, where our team was honored to be awarded the position of **First Runner-Up**.
